#A word is considered elsh if it contains the
#letters: e, l, and f in it, in any order. For example, we would say
#that the following words are elsh: whiteleaf, tasteful, unfriendly,
#and waes, because they each contain those letters.
#Write a predicate function called elsh? that, given a word,
#tells us if that word is elsh or not.
#Write a more generalized predicate function called x-ish? that,
#given two words, returns true if all the letters of therst word
#are contained in the second.
